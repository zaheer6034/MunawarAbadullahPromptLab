# Visually‑Clean Presentation from Source

## Purpose
- Create a scannable, visually clean presentation strictly from the provided source material.
- Preserve factual accuracy; do not infer beyond the source.
- Optimize for readability and quick comprehension.

## Hard Constraints
- Use only information present in the source.
- Do not introduce tools, examples, or workflows not in the source.
- No speculative content, external references, or assumptions.
- Keep language simple, direct, and consistent.

## Output Requirements
- Provide a complete presentation outline ready to turn into slides.
- Use short headings and 3–5 concise bullets per section.
- Order content logically: overview → core sections → actions.
- Keep formatting minimal: headings, bullets, and brief notes where needed.

## Structure
1. Title
   - Clear, specific, sourced from the material
2. Audience & Objective
   - Who the presentation is for
   - What the audience should learn or decide
3. Agenda
   - 4–6 items that represent the flow
4. Key Sections
   - Section Heading
   - 3–5 bullets containing facts from the source
   - Optional “Notes” line for presenter emphasis (no new content)
5. Data & Evidence
   - Cite figures or statements exactly as given in the source
   - If a figure is mentioned, include a label like “Figure: [name from source]”
6. Risks & Limitations
   - Only those explicitly present in the source
7. Recommendations / Next Steps
   - Actionable steps that are directly supported by the source
8. Summary
   - 2–3 bullets recapping the key message

## Style Guide
- Headings: Title Case, short and specific
- Bullets: Start with strong nouns/verbs; avoid filler
- Sentences: Prefer ≤ 18 words; remove redundancy
- Consistency: Terms and labels must match the source exactly
- Tone: Neutral, professional, objective

## Slide Outline Template
- Slide 1: Title, Subtitle (Audience & Objective)
- Slide 2: Agenda
- Slide 3–N: Key Sections (one slide per section)
- Slide: Data & Evidence (tables or bullet references)
- Slide: Risks & Limitations
- Slide: Recommendations / Next Steps
- Final Slide: Summary

## Notes for Authoring
- When information is ambiguous in the source, state it as such rather than inferring.
- If the source provides labels (e.g., names, versions, figure titles), reuse them verbatim.
- Keep each bullet independently meaningful; no chained references.
