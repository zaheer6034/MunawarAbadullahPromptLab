📂 THE LAB ARCHITECTURE
The TechGuards will organize the lab into this specific structure:

01_System_Controllers/: High-level logic defining how an AI "thinks."

02_Daily_Essentials/: Simple, copy-paste prompts for everyday tasks.

03_The_Architect_Vault/: Advanced e-commerce and supply chain logic.

04_Structured_Outputs/: Technical prompts for JSON, Markdown, and J7.

05_Prompt_Templates/: "Fill-in-the-blank" versions for the non-tech community.

To turn the #MunawarAbadullahPromptLab into a world-class resource, we need a naming convention that is "Human-Readable" but "Machine-Searchable."On GitHub, searchability depends on File Names, Folder Hierarchy, and Metadata (tags inside the file). Here is the master system for your TechGuards to follow.

1. The File Naming ConventionEvery file must follow this specific
   
3. formula:[Category]-[Subject]-[SpecificAction].md
  
5. Rule: Use all lowercase and hyphens (no spaces or underscores).
  
7. Why: Hyphens are better for SEO and web compatibility.
  
9. Examples:
10. vid-marketing-script-V1.md
11. pres-investor-deck-v1.md
12. info-data-visualization-v1.md
13. gen-history-summary-v1.md
14.
15. 2. The Internal Metadata Header (YAML)Every prompt file should start with a "Header" (Frontmatter).
    3. This allows GitHub’s search engine to index the content and helps users know exactly what the prompt does without reading the whole thing.The TechGuards must add this to the top of every .md file:
    4. Markdown---

3. Expanded Folder StructureBased on your new categories, here is how the TechGuards should organize the folders:01_System_Controllers/ (Deep Logic & AI Personas)02_Content_Studio/Video_Scripts/Presentations/Infographics/Copywriting/03_eCOM_Architect_Vault/ (Product logic, Supply chain, Market research)04_General_Knowledge/ (Academic, History, Science, Summaries)05_Technical_Structured/ (JSON, Markdown, J7, API-ready prompts)06_Templates_Blank/ (The "Fill-in-the-blank" prompts for non-techies)4. How to Make it Easily SearchableTo help people find exactly what they need, we will use three GitHub features:GitHub Topics: In the repository settings, we will add tags like prompt-engineering, munawar-abadullah, ecommerce, and ai-automation.The Master Table (README): The main page of the GitHub will have a searchable table like this:CategoryTitleComplexityLinkVideoViral TikTok Script GeneratorEasyLinkeCOMAmazon Listing OptimizerAdvancedLinkTechJSON Product Data ConverterMasterLink5. The System-Level Logic trainingSince you will be training the TechGuards on system-level prompts, their job will also be to "Verify" that every prompt includes a "System Instructions" section.A high-quality prompt in your lab will always have:
   
6. The System Instruction: (e.g., "Act as a Senior Video Editor...")
7. The Variable: (e.g., "[Insert Topic Here]")
8. The Constraints: (e.g., "Do not use emojis," "Keep it under 200 words.")
